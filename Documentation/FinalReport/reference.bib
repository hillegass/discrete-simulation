	Abstract = {The number of people affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing in the United Kingdom driven by population ageing. The treatment of the disease is complex, resource intensive and currently there is no known cure to PD. The National Health Service (NHS), the public organisation delivering healthcare in the UK, is under financial pressures. There is a need to find innovative ways to improve the operational and financial performance of treating PD patients. The use of community services is a new and promising way of providing treatment and care to PD patients at reduced cost than hospital care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential operational and financial benefits, which could be achieved through increased integration of community services in the delivery of treatment and care to PD patients in the UK without compromising care quality.},

 abstract = {STDSIM is a dynamic stochastic simulation model for decision support in attempts to control sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It describes the mechanisms responsible for the transmission of five STDs, including HIV/AIDS, at the level of individuals. A large variety of outcome measures (for example, STD prevalence, incidence, and mortality) can be calculated for different groups of the population (for example, adolescents, prostitutes, pregnant women, and migrants) to evaluate the effects of alternative STD control interventions. We designed the model to support decision making for different settings in developing countries, with Nairobi (Kenya) as its first application area. The model adequately describes STD prevalences and the time-trend of HIV prevalence measured in Nairobi. As an illustration of the possibilities of the model, we show model predictions of the effects of improved STD care and increased condom use on the prevalence and incidence of HIV.},

abstract = "Many models of infectious disease ignore the underlying contact structure through which the disease spreads. However, in order to evaluate the efficacy of certain disease control interventions, it may be important to include this network structure. We present a network modeling framework of the spread of disease and a methodology for inferring important model parameters, such as those governing network structure and network dynamics, from readily available data sources. This is a general and flexible framework with wide applicability to modeling the spread of disease through sexual or close contact networks. To illustrate, we apply this modeling framework to evaluate HIV control programs in sub-Saharan Africa, including programs aimed at concurrent partnership reduction, reductions in risky sexual behavior, and scale up of HIV treatment.",

abstract="Realizing the full individual and population-wide benefits of antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requires an efficient mechanism of HIV-related health service delivery. We developed a system dynamics model of the continuum of HIV care in Vancouver, Canada, which reflects key activities and decisions in the delivery of antiretroviral therapy, including HIV testing, linkage to care, and long-term retention in care and treatment. To measure the influence of operational interventions on population health outcomes, we incorporated an HIV transmission component into the model. We determined optimal resource allocations among targeted and routine testing programs to minimize new HIV infections over five years in Vancouver. Simulation scenarios assumed various constraints informed by the local health policy. The project was conducted in close collaboration with the local health care providers, Vancouver Coastal Health Authority and Providence Health Care.",
